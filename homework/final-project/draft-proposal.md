Vaccination rates have been in the news for the last few months as cases of the measles have been popping up nationwide. Looking at the California Department of Health Data, Laura and I hope to put together a program that analyzes Personal Belief Exemptions from the last 10-15 years. 

Based on my project for Cheryl’s class last quarter, I found that although there have been more news of disease outbreaks this year, vaccination exemption numbers have actually decreased 8 percent in the state of California. Counties like San Francisco saw a 23 percent decrease in personal belief exemptions, Santa Barbara saw an 18 percent drop and San Diego saw an 11 percent drop. Between 2012 to 2013 there was a small increase in vaccination opt-outs, so the decrease this past year is a significant victory.

However, for this project, I think it would be very interesting to look at longer-term trends from the data available to us from the California Department of Health website.

The site also looks at specific types of shots students can receive and the percentage that receive them. These include, MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) as well as the Polio vaccine and others. I did not look at these specific numbers for Cheryl’s class but if possible, it would be interesting to see if specific shots have become more or less popular for students to receive. 

I would like to write a code with Laura that does the following:
-	Curls each year with vaccination rates for the past 15 years
-	Grep for XLS
-	Write a for loop that downloads each file into a director
-	Cleans up the data so that our code only looks at schools that have existed for the last 15 years and would therefore show an accurate trend (using a SED command?)
-	Converts the data from XLS format to CSV
-	Potentially chart out this data into line graphs that show an increase or decrease in Personal Belief Exemptions over the last decade
-	Visualize the schools that are the outliers in the trends and those that fall into the majority
